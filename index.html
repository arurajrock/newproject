   	<p id="second">Hotstar (also known as Disney+ Hotstar[b]) is an Indian brand of subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service owned by Star India and operated by Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, both a division of The Walt Disney Company.

The brand was first introduced as Hotstar, for a streaming service carrying content from Star India's local networks, including films, television series, live sports, and original programming, as well as featuring content licensed from third-parties such as HBO and Showtime among others. Amid the significant growth of mobile broadband in India, Hotstar quickly became the dominant streaming service in the country.

Following the acquisition of Star India's parent company 21st Century Fox by Disney in 2019, Hotstar was integrated with the company's new global streaming brand Disney+ as Disney+ Hotstar in April 2020. The co-branded service added Disney+ original programming, and films and television series from its main content brands of Walt Disney Studios, Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, and National Geographic alongside the domestic and third-party content already carried on the platform.

Outside of India, the Disney+ Hotstar service also operates in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, which similarly combines entertainment content licensed from local, third-party studios, with the larger Disney+ library. Disney+ Hotstar is also expected to launch in the Philippines and Vietnam in 2022. In Canada, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States, Hotstar operates as a streaming service targeting overseas Indians, focusing on Star India's domestic entertainment and sports content; Disney+ operates as a standalone service in these markets. In 2021, Disney announced that it would discontinue the U.S. version of Hotstar in November 2021, in favour of adding its content to the domestic Hulu and ESPN+ services instead.</p><br><br><br>
